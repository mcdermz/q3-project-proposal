# Soundcloud clone
## A collaborative app for musicians

### What
* A simple SPA that is geared towards making it easier for musicians to collaborate on musical works in progress.

### Why
* Applications like soundcloud are super cool, but are very crowded with social media features. 

* This app aims to create a simple site for musicians in the process of recording to upload mixes of their work in progress and provide an easy platform for bandmates and/or consultants to provide general feedback or at specific moments of a track to facilitate a more productive work flow.

### How
* Uploading and streaming audio files will require us to learn some new technologies. We will need to establish some form of [FTP](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ftp) in conjunction with [binaryJS](https://www.olindata.com/en/blog/2014/01/file-uploading-and-streaming-binaryjs) or the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API). Because of our lack of experience with these technologies we will most likely stick to a standard NEAP stack for the application development.
